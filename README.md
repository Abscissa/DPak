# DPak
A currently design-phase reboot of DUB's package management.

DUB has filled an important need for D, and has been instrumental
in getting us to where we are today. But moving forward, there
are fundamental design problems with DUB which prevent us from
reaching where we need to go next. Possibly the biggest issue
is DUB combining package management with being a buildsystem.
This project aims to be a smoothly-transitioned redesign and
replacement for the package management features of DUB.

Currently, this is in early-design phase with no running code.
What we need right now is to collect requirements and start designing
how the basic core should work. This will be done through this
project's issues/PRs and Wiki.

Some of the informal discussion that led to this repo:
